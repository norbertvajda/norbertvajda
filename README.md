## Hello World 👋

I'm Norbert Vajda, a full-stack web developer and TALL-Stack enthusiast from Zagreb.

I have 12+ years expertise with PHP (vanilla PHP, various frameworks and CMS systems), vanilla JavaScript and CSS, while I started to learn Laravel (v5.4) in 2017.

As self-employment (RootPixel Design), I build and maintain robust, scalable and efficient Laravel - mainly in TALL stack - web applications since 2020. I have also exertise in building (with GreenSock's GSAP) full animated - and traditional - landing pages. I also have a lot of experience in refactoring, optimizing, and correcting existing web applications, and configuring webservers and optimize databases - thanks to the fact that I am a system administrator by profession (and business informatics) and have 5+ years of professional experience in this field.

🛠️ **Technical Stack:**
* PHP (currently v8.4)
* Laravel (currently v12)
* JavaScript (vanilla, Modern ES6+), Livewire (latest projects with v3.6), AlpineJS
* CSS3, SCSS Preprocessor, Tailwind
* Database Architecture & Optimization

🔊 **Spoken languages:**

I am always open to discussing new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out at 'nobo.vajda' on my Gmail.
